**Title of the study:** The infectivity of virus particles from _Wolbachia_ infected _Drosophila_
**Short summary of the study:**
 Wolbachia is an endosymbiotic bacterium that infects various arthropods, including medically important insects such as mosquitoes. While it can block viral infections in its hosts, the mechanisms behind Wolbachia-mediated viral blocking are not yet fully understood. Recently, several strains of Wolbachia have been shown to reduce the infectivity of virus grown in its presence, referred to henceforth as progeny virus, in cell culture. This study aims to investigate the breadth of this mechanism by determining if Wolbachia reduces infectivity across different virus families within the whole organism Drosophila melanogaster. Two different viruses, Drosophila C virus (DCV; Family Dicistroviridae) and Flock House virus (FHV; Famliy Nodaviridae) were grown in adult Drosophila melanogaster flies with and without Wolbachia strain wMelPop. Measures of the physical characteristics, infectivity, pathogenicity, or replicative properties of progeny virus particles showed Wolbachia had no impact on either DCV or FHV. Therefore, there is no evidence that changes in infectivity contribute to Wolbachia¬¬-mediated viral blocking in this system, suggesting this may be a system specific mechanism. Overall, this is consistent with growing evidence that the mechanisms behind Wolbachia viral blocking are dependent on the unique tripartite interactions occurring between the host the Wolbachia strain and the infecting virus.
